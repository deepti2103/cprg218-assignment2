This period proved her creativity and flexibility as one of the most important and unique artists of this generation.In the year 2012 with the released album Red Swift continued to expand her style which was a fusion of country, pop, rock, and electronica. The album was filled with other hit songs like 'We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together' which have catchy lyrics are a testament to a breakup anthem; 'I knew you were trouble 'in which the element of dub step was introduced. 'Red' was more of an emotional spectrum and tried to romanticize love, lost love and discovering one's self. This change in sound and tone could only suggest that she is perfect for moving out of country music while keeping her narrative strengths. 1989 in 2014 became Swift's full on pop album, which was inspired from the 1980s synthesised music. This is an album which really solidified her style, and she moved very much into a clean, positive pop kind of sound. The songs like 'Shake It Off' was all about resistance to trolling and 'Blank Space' tapping into the world's stereotype view of her relationships. Single such as 'Style' and 'Wildest Dreams' were so cinematic that they gave the year 1989 a beginning of critical and commercial success. The album that was created won her the Grammy of the Album of the Year, thus placing her firmly on the walls of the pop diva..";

Brought on by her over-eager rivalries and media attention, Reputation was far from the colorful innocence of 1989. Such songs as “Look What You Made Me Do” were to silence the haters and such songs as “Delicate” and “Call It What You Want” were more personal moments of love, and regaining of self. The electropop, hip-hop and some industrial sounds where infused in her album and proved how experimental she is. That being said, Reputation was closer to the previous records, meaning that fans were feeling the raw emotions and proved Taylor's ability to change the image successfully. This five-year period effectively captured both the transition of Swift fro m a country star experimenting with pop to a bonafide pop star. She dare greatly in her experimentation while at the same time successfully mastering the narrative weaving skills as well as visual selecting and defining skills. Thus, by the beginning of 2017, Taylor Swift has once again refashioned her persona on the musical scene, and with this change, one can state that she refuted all the claims that her image transformation is base on her musical versatility.";

After the bright electronic pop accents of Reputation in 2017, she was waiting for a new stage of self-identification and new incredibly diverse genres that she dared to try after 2019's Lover compared to the dark vindictiveness of Reputation. The album became much lighter in themes compared to Some Kind of Trouble, which would discuss love, vulnerability or, in one of the songs, freedom of expression. Songs such as “Lover” which had a back to basics soft synth-pop feel and “You Need to Calm Down”, which was an anthem of gay rights crusade pointed to a change of heart from the singer. The album was created as a mix of synth-pop, indie pop and soft rock, but Swift pursued the more retro concept. With Lover, she was able to come back to the sphere of love that has been presented in her earlier pieces but with a wiser attitude. The album was lauded for the genuine lyrics, melodies and profound messages, that suggested that Swift was back to the simpler, genuine persona after the edgy, controversial period of Reputation.";

This approach of infusing adorable music that goes hand in hand with a mature country ship made swift an instant favorite among the Americans. Other songs like the 'Tim Mc Graw' and 'teardrops on my guitar' marked her as an individual who writes genuine songs hence, giving her a niche in the industry .Swift was able to bring a new concept to the limelight, backed by immense talent and finally fame from her dedicated target group: the young teenagers and fans of country music. Having learnt how to manage her emotions into coming up with songs, telling stories of love, corruption of innocence, growing up, made her one of the most anticipated artist in that dispensation.
